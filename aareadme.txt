						Floating Point Multiplication Emulator Project

This program emulates the multiplication of two single-precision IEEE floating-point numbers. The program reads its inputs from a source
file called “input.txt”. Each line of the input file contains two IEEE floating point numbers in hexidecimal format separated by blanks.

To run the program:

    1. Verify the "Floating_Point_Multiplication_Emulator.exe" file and the "input.txt" file are in the same folder. 
    2. Simply double-click on the "Floating_Point_Multiplication_Emulator.exe" file. After clicking on the file, a console 
       window should open that displays the output of the program. 
    3. The program will pause once it has finished executing. 
    4. To close the program, simply type any key and then press the "enter" key.
